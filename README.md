## Welcome to learn2code


> learn2code was set up to educate young ones on how to code. 

**Primary Goal** - First, and foremost this repo/project, in particular, is for my family. I have a daughter who is exhibiting enthusiasm in what I do (DevOps Engineer). Hopefully, this repository/project will serve as a record for what was taught, learned, and perhaps even stand as a working Journal to be seen later on in time.

**Secondarily** - I do not code much anymore. I live in the realm of Ansible and Architecture. Relearning Python has been a wish of mine for some time. I will be learning while I teach. This will be an entertaining journey, for sure.

**Lastly** - I have decided to make this repository/project public. Perhaps you sought a repo to use to boost your learning, or you may have decided to start on the same journey of sharing the wonder of coding with a little one. I hope this finds you well.
