## Welcome to learn2code


### learn2code was set up to teach young ones how to code.

**Primary Goal** - First, and foremost this repo/project is a personal project for my family. I have a daughter who is showing interest in what I do (DevOps Engineer). Hopefully, this repository/project will serve as a record for what was taught, learned, and maybe even serve as a working Journal to be viewed later on in life.

**Secondarily** - I do not code much anymore. I live in a world of Ansible and Architecture. Relearning Python has been a want of mine for some time. I will be learning while I teach. This will be a fun journey, for sure.

**Lastly** - I have decided to make this repository/project public. Maybe you searched for a repo to use to support your learning, or you may have decided to start on the same journey of sharing the wonder of coding with a little one. I hope this finds you well.
